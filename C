Explanation:
  1.inorderTraversal function: This is a helper function that does an in-order traversal of the BST. It calculates the difference between the current node's value and the previous node's value, updating min_diff 
  if the difference is smaller.
  2.getMinimumDifference function: This function initializes min_diff and prev, and then calls inorderTraversal. Finally, it returns the minimum absolute difference found.



void inorderTraversal(struct TreeNode* root, int* prev, int* min_diff) {
    if (root == NULL) return;
    
    // Traverse the left subtree
    inorderTraversal(root->left, prev, min_diff);
    
    // Process the current node
    if (*prev != -1) { // Skip the first node as there's no previous node to compare
        int diff = root->val - *prev;
        if (diff < *min_diff) {
            *min_diff = diff;
        }
    }
    *prev = root->val; // Update the previous value to current node's value
    
    // Traverse the right subtree
    inorderTraversal(root->right, prev, min_diff);
}

int getMinimumDifference(struct TreeNode* root) {
    int min_diff = INT_MAX;
    int prev = -1; // Initial previous value, indicating the start
    inorderTraversal(root, &prev, &min_diff);
    return min_diff;
}
